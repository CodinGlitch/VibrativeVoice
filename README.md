# Overview
This mod is an addon for [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) that lets your voice interact with vibrations, affecting things like the sculk sensor, sculk shrieker and the Warden!

On top of this, it is also configurable so that you may tweak it to your liking.

## Development
The mod also contains an api to allow developers to transmit their own vibrations using the same frequency.
